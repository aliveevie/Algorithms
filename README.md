# Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges

This repository contains a set of basic algorithm scripting challenges aimed at helping you improve your problem-solving skills and gain a better understanding of fundamental programming concepts.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of programming concepts and the programming language you're using. These challenges are designed to be solved using [language name], but you can choose any programming language you're comfortable with.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Reverse a String

#### Description

Reverse a given string.

#### Example

Input: `"hello"`
Output: `"olleh"`

### Challenge 2: Factorialize a Number

#### Description

Return the factorial of a given positive integer.

#### Example

Input: `5`
Output: `120`

### Challenge 3: Check for Palindromes

#### Description

Check if a given string is a palindrome (a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward).

#### Example

Input: `"racecar"`
Output: `true`

### Challenge 4: Find the Longest Word

#### Description

Return the length of the longest word in a given sentence.

#### Example

Input: `"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"`
Output: `6` (for the word "jumped")

## How to Use

Each challenge is provided in a separate folder. Inside each folder, you'll find a `README.md` file explaining the challenge, its requirements, and some examples. Additionally, you'll find a solution file (or placeholder) where you can write your own code to solve the challenge.
